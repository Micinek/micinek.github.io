Homelab is a place where IT enthusiasts and professionals can learn and experiment without having to risk damaging the production environment. It can be anything from a single older computer running a few services to a virtualization cluster of servers simulating corporate infrastructure.
Homelab is a unique opportunity to acquire skills and practical experience in IT. And if you&rsquo;re just starting out as an IT administrator, homelab can open the door to the world of technology in a way that&rsquo;s affordable, flexible, and above all, safe.">

<li>Theory is the foundation, but in IT, being able to actually set things up, troubleshoot and keep things running is the key. In homelab, you can try operating system management, network configuration, database management, implementation of security policies and much more.</li>

<li>Every IT professional makes mistakes - that&rsquo;s OK. But in a real environment, an error can mean a service outage or even a loss of data, which can cost your company a lot of money. In homelab, you can experiment and make mistakes without worrying about the consequences.</li>

  Together we will go on a journey where we will build a Homelab. We will build our first server, launch various services and learn the practicalities of IT operations. And we will also run a cluster that is useful for uninterrupted operation.
