However, another pleasant adventure got in the way of travel:

<p>My interest in IT was awakened very early, when my father brought home the first computer. I think it was arround when I started elementary school. Of course, the main interests were about gaming&hellip;</p>
<p>Later around 2005, under the auspices of my father, I became involved in a non-profit group building a community wifi network in our town. Here I started to gain experience in the networking and some Linux bascs from my father and other members of the local comunity. I also started to repair computers. After completing my high school diploma, I joined a small company, where I started as an L1 technician. I gained a lot of valuable experience here and actively developed myself inside and outside of work.</p>
